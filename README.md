# dailynewsletter
 
This is a dailynewsletter that scrapes trendy articles on hackernews and emails a summary of each article, along with its source, to a user base.

This is only a personal newsletter.

Used BART NLP model then switched tto newspaper3k NLP as I have found the summaries more accurate with less token restrictions.

As time goes on, I will be developing more accurate methods for scraping articles for even better summaries. More use cases will be added as time goes on.

Planning ona adding summaries of political news, with models that check for bias.
